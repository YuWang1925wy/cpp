| Aspect | Compile-Time Polymorphism | Run-Time Polymorphism |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Also Known As | Static Polymorphism | Dynamic Polymorphism |
| Decision Time | The compiler determines which function or operation to call based on the number, types, and order of arguments. | The decision of which function to call is determined at runtime based on the actual object type rather than the reference or pointer type. |
| Binding | Function calls are statically bound. | Function calls are dynamically bound. |
| Implementation | Achieved through:<br>1. Function Overloading<br>2. Operator Overloading | Achieved through Function Overriding. |
| Execution Speed | Faster execution rate. | Comparatively slower execution rate. |
| Inheritance | Inheritance is not involved. | Involves inheritance. |
