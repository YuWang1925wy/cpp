// repository: a storage location where your code and related files (like documentation, scripts, and data) are saved and managed
// pre-built binaries: software files that have already been compiled from source code into executable programs

// include directory: a bunch of header files so that we can use the functions in the library
// library directory(lib): has pre-built binaries
